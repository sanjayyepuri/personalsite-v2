title: About Me

---

Hi, Iâ€™m a freshman at the University of Texas @ Austin, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am interested in Full Stack Development, and have recently gotten into Computer Architecture and Rust.  I have two years of professional software development experience and am looking for more! 

Feel free to shoot me an email if you have anything to say, interesting articles, job opportunities, etc.
