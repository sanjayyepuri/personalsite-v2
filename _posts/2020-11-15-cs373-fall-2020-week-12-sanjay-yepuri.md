#### What did you do this past week?
I did not make any progress on our website, The Politician. However, I took what I had learned about integrating Algolia and built out the mentor search feature for my non-profit's website.

---
#### What's in your way?
There is nothing blocking progress.
---
#### What will you do next week?
This next week our team and I will build out visualizations for the data we have on our politicians. We hope to build maps that showcase how the corresponding districts that the politician had constituents in and how well he had performed. Additionally, we want to visualize what key policies and issues played well across different races in the country.

#### If you read it, what did you think of The New Methodology?
"The New Methodology," which is not so new for me, was an interesting perspective, detailing how the author viewed Agile development with other paradigms such as Extreme Programming.  He lists out the details of older methodologies that try to separate design from development and their pitfalls. The main idea is that predicting requirements during the design phase is a difficult task; software development should become the design phase where requirements are iterated upon.

#### What was your experience with SQL? (this question will vary, week to week)
My experience with SQL this week has been good. The last time I had worked through the language was in high school. It was a good refresher to implement the different kinds of joins. I did learn more use cases for subqueries and how they can be used to implement queries not possible with joins.

#### What made you happy this week?
This is a little thing, but very satisfying. I noticed how quickly the  Visual Studio Code's Intellisense was able to pick up the type-information and suggest a particular class's methods. As an experiment, I downloaded sublime text and PyCharm to compare and was surprised to see that neither of them did the same. It was great to see how mature visual studio code had become and how useful of a tool it is.

#### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
The Language Server Protocol is my pick of the week. This a protocol that defines how text editors communicate with a language server that provides features such as autocompletion. An editor that can support this protocol should be able to have IDE-like features for any language that has a Language server.
