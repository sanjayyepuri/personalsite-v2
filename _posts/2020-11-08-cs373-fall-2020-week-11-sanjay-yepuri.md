#### What did you do this past week?
This past week my team and I implemented the search and filtering requirements for our class project. I built out the front end components used across models for search and data display. I spent some time building out my own custom components rather than the ones provided by Algolia.

---
#### What's in your way?
Currently, there is nothing in my way. For our next phase, my team and I must brainstorm creative data visualizations we should add to our website.

---
#### What will you do next week?
Since the election is over, I am going to look for datasets containing voter information in addition to the results of the elections we have on our website. The electoral college visualizations displayed on many mainstream media websites were interesting, and we will try to mimic these visualizations. .

#### If you read it, what did you think of The Dependency Inversion Principle?
The Dependency Inversion Principle described an interesting concept I believe I have thought of naturally. It formalized the notion of building layers of abstractions that would be implemented by specialized classes. This way, components in higher layers only need to depend on the behavior defined in interfaces.

#### What was your experience of instance methods, class methods, static methods, regular expressions, and relational algebra? (this question will vary, week to week)
The lectures for relational algebra were intuitive. I connected the ideas with the Algebraic Structures classes I have taken. With our knowledge of iterators, it was easy to implement the operations we defined in Python.

#### What made you happy this week?
I started to play a rouge-like game called Hades. It is well made and pretty fun. It is about a Demi-god trying to escape from the underworld to Mt. Olympus.

---
#### What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?
I mentioned this on Piazza, but Algolia really made implementing search and filtering simple. We connected our SQL database and created indices for each of our models. Then, we imported their React library to implement the search user interface. It was one of those situations where everything worked nearly perfectly on the first try. Algolia's developer documentation was detailed and straight forward, and their developer guides covered the common use cases we needed.  We customized their widgets to fit our website and display the data we needed. They even had a module that automated text highlighting. The only concern I have is their pricing model. I almost blew past their free tier developing the application.
