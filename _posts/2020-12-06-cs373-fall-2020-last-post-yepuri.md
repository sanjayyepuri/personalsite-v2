#### Key Takeaways
I took a few key ideas from Software Engineering this semester.

- test first, test during, test after, test, test, test
- when designing algorithms, demand the weakest capabilities (e.g. iterable vs. indexable)
- when designing containers, provide the strongest capabilities (e.g. indexable vs iterable)
- build decorators on top of containers, iterators, and functions
- utilize the benefits of being lazy (i.e. yield)
- always look for reuse and symmetry in your code
- collaboration is essential to the quality of your code and to your well-being in producing it

#### How the course conveyed these takeaways?

Professor Downing did a great job of methodologically going over the various concepts over the semester. The test-driven lectures in addition to the HackerRanks made lectures easy to follow. The HackerRanks then allowed us to immediately apply what was covered solidifying our understanding. This routine made the above takeaways easy to understand and remember.

### My Particular Takeaways

The importance of testing was made apparent by the way Professor Downing uses tests to define the expected behavior of the various programming concepts he covered. He defined anything ranging from how various container methods were expected to outputs of SQL queries. He then emphasized and required integrating tests into build pipelines for our projects. We were able to use these tests to ensure that our website functioned well and to prevent features from introducing new bugs.

Personally, Professor Downing's coverage of Python was great. He went over all the most useful topics in my opinion that I had come across many times. Even though I was familiar with decorators, containers, etc., the lectures solidified my understanding.

Finally, the project that we worked on throughout the semester allowed me to practice good software engineering in terms of design. As a group, we were able to build a website that had low code duplication and good coverage. We planned and designed components that were extendable and reusable across the website.

#### Two-Stage Quizzes and Tests

The two-stage quizzes and tests in my opinion were an interesting addition. For the most part, they were not difficult for me. However, going over them with a group of peers helped me find things I didn't understand even though I had answered the questions correctly. The back-and-forth with my teammates was useful and engaging.

#### Cold Calling?
I don't think that "cold calling" does justice to what actually happens. Professor Downing does not call on students to put them on the spot or to ensure they were paying attention (as the main goal). The main goal I believe is to keep the class engaged and paying attention. When cold-called, Professor Downing may ask a few questions about the code he currently is showing the class. To me, it seemed that he simply wanted to have taught us through a conversation with a student rather than having a more one-directional lecture. Cold calling is simply a means to ensure that he always has a "willing" volunteer.

#### Office Hours & Lab Sessions
I did not attend these, however, from what I hear the TAs are amazing and incredibly helpful.

#### Suggestions for the Course
I think the course for me has been enjoyable. It is always incredibly fun to work on a semi-large project with a group of people. My only complaint is that some of the requirements for the project seemed unnecessarily specific. (Not sure how to exact word the issue.) For example, requiring three models in a SQL database all connected seems like a very restrictive requirement. I can understand what it is there, but I felt that that initial ideation phase for the project heavily revolved around having three distinctive models.

#### For Those on the Fence

Take this class. You will learn a lot and you will get great practice building, what I would consider, a REAL project end to end. Something you may not even encounter in industry since is likely you will work on something that already exists.
