#### What did you do this past week?

This past week, I completed the Collatz Project and submitted it. Besides that, a friend had messaged me to join their team for this semester's projects.

---
#### What’s in your way?

Nothing.

---
#### What will you do next week?

I am going to take a look at Julia since I didn't get to it this past one. Also, I will be working on automating deployment using a release branch for coved.org.

---
#### What was your experience of exceptions, IDB1, and types? (this question will vary, week to week)*?

Exceptions were an interesting topic to discuss. In Go and Rust, there are no exceptions; instead, all functions return a tuple or a Result type.

Additionally, The IDB1 project seems like a lot of fun. It will be great to learn how to deploy applications to cloud providers and practice Python. Also, I am excited to work on a new team.

---
#### How are you doing and holding up? What’s been most helpful for you in terms of support at this time?

I am doing great. Piazza and classmates have helped me stay on track and answer any questions I had about the project.

---
#### What made you happy this week?
There hasn't been anything this week to make me not happy.

---
#### What’s your **pick-of-the-week** or **tip-of-the-week**?

My pick of the week is Github Pages. This service provided by Github hosts websites published via a repository. This is how I publish my blog. It is simple to use and reliable; all that is needed is a repository with an `index.html` file.
